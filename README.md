Quantum comping is an area of computing first formulated by several computer theorists the early 
1980s (1)(2)(3) which uses the effects of quantum mechanics to perform computational tasks. While 
classical computing uses a binary 1/0 bit quantum computing uses a Qubit which holds a superposition
of states between 1 and 0 and works within a world that is filled with probabilities rather than 
solid deterministic type sitatuions. This allows a quantum computer to work with bits that hold the probability
of the bit being in a state of 1 or 0. Another interesting feature of quantum computing is that quantum
bits exist in a proability of being in a certain state until the bit is measured. This allows for the 
use of quantum computing to solve problems that are currently too coputationally heavy to solve on a 
classical computer.
